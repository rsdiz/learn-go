// If you're lucky, the test will pass, and sometimes test will fail
// Sometimes, when we run our tests, two of the goroutines write to the results map at exactly the same time.
// Maps in Go don't like it when more than one thing tries to write to them at once, and so fatal error.
// This is a race condition, a bug that occurs when the output of our software is dependent on
// the timing and sequence of events that we have no control over.
// Because we cannot control exactly when each goroutine writes to the results map,
// we are vulnerable to two goroutines writing to it at the same time.
// Go can help us to spot race conditions with its built in race detector (https://blog.golang.org/race-detector).
// To enable this feature, run the tests with the race flag: go test -race.
