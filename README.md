# My Journey on Learning Go Programming Language

The contents of this repository is my coding journey, where the secrets of Go programming unfold, I navigate through the digital labyrinth, armed with determination and a keyboard. With each line of code, I unravel the mysteries of Go, like an adventurer on a quest for explore a dungeon full of mysteries.

The equipment I use:

- [Go](https://go.dev) (1.22.0)
- [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) by [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) (2023.3.4)
