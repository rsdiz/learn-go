/**
Interface,
is an abstract datatype, it doesn't have direct implementation.
An interface contains definition of methods.
An interface usually used as a contract.

Implementation Interface,
any datatype that conforms to an interface contract is automatically considered to be that interface,
so we don't need to implement the interface manually.
This is different with another programming language, where we must explicitly state which interface we will use.

Empty Interface,
Go-lang is not an object-oriented programming.
Usually, in OOP there is one parent data at the top which can be considered as all the data implementations.
Some example, in Java there is java.lang.Object
To handle this case in go-lang, we can use empty interface.
Empty interface is an interface that has no methods, this means that all data types will automatically
be considered as that interface implementation.

Example in Go-lang:
- fmt.Println(a ...interface{})
- panic(v interface{})
- recover() interface{}
